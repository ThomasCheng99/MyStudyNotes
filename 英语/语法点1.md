1. 一般公司中级别、地位高的人会拥有自己的办公室，俗称：corner office

2. I don’t know that he has finished the work yet.

   解析：yet 用于否定和疑问句，already用于肯定句。把yet 改为already.

3. He said nearly nothing at the meeting.

   解析：nearly 不与否定词用在同一个句子中，而almost可以。因此把nearly 改为almost.

4. He usually goes to school by his father’s car.

   解析：by加上名词表示一种交通方式，中间什么都不加，如by car, by bus, by plane等；如果名词前有其他的词修饰，则应除by以外的其他介词，此处把by改为in.

5. He used to get up very early in the morning, and now he is still doing so.

   解析：used to 用来表示过去常常做某事而现在不了，所以应把后半句改为：but now he is not doing so.

6. I needn’t come yesterday because all the work had been finished.

   解析：由于情态动词本身不体现时态，所以在谈论过去的事情时在情态动词后加 have done，因此在 needn’t 后加have。

7. You hadn’t better stay up too late because you have to get up early tomorrow.

   解析：had better 的否定在 better 后面加not.

8. I will tell her about that when she will come tomorrow.

   解析：主句为将来时，其时间、条件、方式和让步状语从句中用一般现在时。因此将will come改为comes。

9. The meeting is about to begin in ten minutes.

   解析：be about to 一般不与具体的时间状语连用。因此把 in ten minutes 去掉。

10. I have bought this bike for ten years and I am still using it now.

    解析：当句中有for加一段时间作状语时，谓语动词必须为延续性动词，此处把bought改为kept。

11. He is being operated by the famous doctor.

    解析：主动语态变为被动语态时，应注意短语动词的完整性，别忘了介词或副词。“给…做手术”应为operate on sb，所以在operated 后加上on。

12. Having not seen her for many years, we could hardly recognize her.

    解析：现在分词的否定应把not放在现在分词前面，所以前半句应改为：Not having

13. This history book is worthy reading.

    解析：“值得被做”可以有如下几种说法：be worth doing; be worthy of being done; be worthy to be done. 因此本句应该为：This history book is worthy to be read.

14. Being seriously ill, his class-mates sent him to hospital.

    解析：分词作状语时，其逻辑主语为这句话的主语，此句应为“因为他病了，他的同学才把他送到医院去”，因此把前半句改为：He being seriously ill.

15. Seeing from the space, the earth looks like a ball.

    解析：分词作状语，其逻辑主语应是这句话的主语，此句中地球应该被看，所以把Seeing 改为Seen。

16. I will get somebody repair the recorder for you.

    解析：“让某人做某事”可以有以下几种表达法：make sb do sth; have sb do sth; get sb to sth. 因此在repair 前加to。

17. We are talking about if this plan should be carried out.

    解析：If 和whether都可以引导动词的宾语从句，如果从句做的是介词宾语，只能用whether引导。所以把if 改为whether。

18. This is the very thing which I lost yesterday.

    解析：如果先行词为物且前有the only, the last, the very修饰时，定语从句的引导词只能用that。

19. The poet and writer are invited to give a speech at the meeting.

    解析：poet和writer共用一个冠词，指的是一个人身兼二职，所以谓语动词应为单数。把are改为is.

20. No one except my parents know it.

    解析：主语后加except再加上若干数量的名词，谓语动词和主语保持一致。所以把know改为knows。类似的用法的词或短语有：but, besides, with, together with, along with, as well as等等。
