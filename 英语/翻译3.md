（改善农村教育）为了促进教育公平，中国已经投入360亿元，用于改善农村地区教育设施和加强中西部地区农村义务教育。这些资金用于改善教学设施、购买书籍，使16万多所中小学收益。资金还用于购置音乐和绘画器材。现在农村和山区的儿童可以与沿海城市的儿童一样上音乐和绘画课。一些为接受更好教育而转往城市上学的学生如今又回到了本地农村学校就读。

The funds were used to better school facilities, buy books, which benefited more than 160,000 primary and secondary schools. They were also spent to purchase music and painting apparatus. Nowadays children in rural and mountainous areas can have music and art classes the same as those children in coastal cities. Some students who transfer to cities for better education return to the local rural schools again.

（发展核能）中国应该进一步发展核能，因为核电目前只占其总发电数的2%。该比例在所有核电国家中居第30位，几乎是最低的。2011年3月日本人核电站事故后，中国的核能开发停了下来，中止审批新的核电站，并开展全国性的核电安全检查。到2012年10月，审批才又谨慎的恢复。随着技术和安全措施的改进，发生核事故的可能性完全可以降到最低程度。换句话说，核能是可以安全开发和利用的。

【参考译文】China should further develop nuclear energy because nuclear power accounts for only 2% of its total generating capacity currently. Such proportion ranks the thirtieth in all the countries possessing nuclear power, which is almost the last.After Japan’s nuclear power accident in March 2011, nuclear power development in China was suspended, so was the approval of new nuclear power plants. Also, the national safety check for the nuclear power was carried out. It was not until October 2012 that the approval was prudently resumed.With the improvement of technology and safety measures, there is little possibility for nuclear accidents to happen. In other words, there won’t be any trouble to develop and exploit the nuclear power.

（读书的重要性）中国教育工作者早就认识到读书对于国家的重要意义。有些教育工作者2003年就建议设立全国读书日。他们强调，人们应当读好书，尤其是经典著作。通过阅读，人们能更好地学会感恩、有责任心和与人合作，而教育的目的正是要培养这些基本素质。阅读对于中小学生尤为重要，假如他们没有在这个关键时期培养阅读的兴趣，以后要养成阅读的习惯就很难了。

【参考译文】Chinese educators have already realized the significant meaning of reading for the country. Some educators suggested setting aside a special day for national reading in 2003. What they emphasized is reading good books, especially classical works. People could better learn to feel grateful, have more sense of responsibility, be willing to cooperate with others through reading, which is exactly fit for the purpose of education. It is more important for primary and secondary students to read. Were they not interested in reading at the critical time, developing habit for reading in the future will be more difficult.
